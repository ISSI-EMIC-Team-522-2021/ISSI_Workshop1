## Case studies of High amplitude EMIC waves during non-storm time from Van Allen Probe. 

The highest wave amplitudes seem to occur during non-storm conditions 

Contributors: Remya, Ben, Alexa, Lauren and her Students, Miyoshi can look at Arase for this!, Vanya  (Ben can provide with location w.r.t. magnetopause)

So this is maybe 2 studies one (or more) case studies with data and modeling groups and one statistical based. 

### Why some quiet time substorms create EMIC waves and most do not 

From Van Allen Probes era - follow up of the above study.

## Compare different Van Allen Probes Statistical studies. 

How much do they agree or disagree. 

Contributors: Dedong Wang and .... Remya and Alexa happy to help

## Compare different statistical studies from the different missions 

THEMIS, CLUSTER, CREES, AMPTE, Arase, Van Allen Probes, Akabono, MMS, GEOS, GOES, etc. 

**This should be part of the observational review - not it's own seperate study** - make sure these are all included in the notes for the appropriate sections. 

## Compare different EMIC wave identification methods 
Perhaps see if we can compare different identification methods 
* for example Compare Andy, Remya, Claudia, and maybe Sigsbee (we need to ask her but they may already be doing this - so either hurry up or wait for their result).  
* Lauren may have a student who could use and look at this as well. (could we have a bunch of students or non-students to look at a specific period and see how much their data bases differ) 

Look at changing the thresholds in things like Bortink's model and how much that changes the false negatives and posititives and can ML help with identifying the right thresholds to use. Use the ML to identify false postitives  - so maybe we shouldn't use just one method use these two together. 

Use identification of bite outs in the particle data to state when there is an EMICs. 
* Do the bite outs last longer than the Wave? 

## Compare stats from Van Allen, Arase, and CRRES 

How much difference is because of orbit vs solar cycle. 

* Need to make sure same method is used to identify EMIC Waves
* Use same analysis type. (e.g. dial plots vs other etc. 
* Should we use the same time period? ~18 months? 

Maybe this starts with just the intercallibration between the Arase and Van Allen Probes. 
* Olesky did this for whistler - were EMIC also observed. [Santolik 2021](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JA029700)

## Compare local/bounced averaged diffusion coeffients with EMIC location and plasma pause/plume conditions. 

How well do waves in different locations interact with relativitistic particles (if they are there - first assume the particles are there - then look to see if they are. So if there were MeV elctrons at L=9 MLT = noon would the wave be effective => state how they might not be due to lack of those MeV particles in that location). 


## September 13th - 14th 2015 
Wide L-value range where EMIC waves were observed (~L=3 to ~L=10) [Yu](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JA023982)

* Can we see poynting flux 
* Can we see E-field 
* Can we see composition
* Why so quiet so what made this thing turn on? (Spatial spread in MLT seen during recovery phase of weak/moderate geomagnetic storms - [Blum](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL087009)

## Jan 25 - 26th 2013 

EMIC wave induced precipitation [Zhang](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JA022918)

What does the phase space density look like here - and do we see a dip. 


## Jan 17th 2013 storm

BARREL saw a very brief period of potentially relativistic precipitation  - there was a long lasting dip - but still sporatic precipitation events as observed by BARREL. 


## Ions 
* Observations of Ion composition and charge of ions 
  - charge of ionospheric oxygen outflow 
  - charge of solar wind oxygen 
  - Are they large enough compositions to matter? 
  - How is this different at Jupiter and other locations. 

[Mauk's paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JA020392)


## Temperature anisotropy along B. 
This would be able to show where A* is maximum (Eg.  if Isotropic it's at the magnetic equator - what if it's peaked at 45deg? )


## Dec 12 2015 - Jan 12 2016 storms 
There are a lot of papers and cool events during this time. 
* [Paper Remya shared which started the discusion](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020JA028027)
* [Dan's first find](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020JA029072)
* [Dan's second find with EMIC waves](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2019JA027424)
* [Dan's third find with SW impacts from this event](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016SW001455)
